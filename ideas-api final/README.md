# Ideas API Final

A Node.js + Express REST API for managing ideas. The API includes authentication, CRUD operations, testing, and is built with scalability in mind.

---
# Features

- User authentication (JWT-based).
- CRUD operations for ideas.
- SQLite database integration.
- Input validation & error handling.
- Unit & integration tests (Jest + Supertest).
- CORS protection (production-ready configuration).

---

# Run & setup :
```bash
npm install express
node server.js
```
# API Endpoints

## Auth
- POST /register → Register a new user
- POST /login → Login and receive a JWT

## Ideas
- GET /ideas → Fetch all ideas
- POST /ideas → Create a new idea (requires Authorization: Bearer <token>)
- PUT /ideas/:id → Update an idea (requires auth)
- DELETE /ideas/:id → Delete an idea (requires auth)

---

# Testing
- Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```
- Uses Jest and Supertest.
- Includes authentication tests and CRUD tests.

---

# Deployment
- For production deployment:
1. Use PM2 or Docker for process management.
2. Configure CORS to only allow trusted domains.
3. Use environment variables for sensitive data.
4. Deploy to a cloud provider (Heroku, AWS, Azure, etc.).

# Scalability Strategy
1. Horizontal Scaling
- Run multiple instances of the Node.js app with PM2 cluster mode, Docker Swarm, or Kubernetes.
- Distribute requests across instances for better performance.

2. Database Scaling
- Start with query optimization & indexing.
- Use read replicas for read-heavy workloads.
- Consider sharding if dataset grows large.
- Move to managed DB services (AWS RDS, GCP SQL, etc.) for automated scaling.

3. Load Balancing
- Use NGINX, HAProxy, or AWS ELB to spread requests across multiple instances.
- Ensures fault tolerance and high availability.

4. Caching
- Use Redis/Memcached for caching frequently accessed data.
- Apply HTTP caching with proper headers for static or slow-changing responses.

5. Microservices (Future Option)
- Split API into smaller services if the system grows:
    - **Auth Service**: Handles registration/login.
    - **Ideas Service**: Manages idea CRUD.
    - **Notification Service**: Sends alerts/emails.
- Enables independent scaling and faster development cycles.
